# Time_Depend_Schrodinger_Sol_PinAB
Here provides a jupyter notebook that holds solving the time dependent Schr√∂dinger equation. This is done using a Crank Nicolson algorithm. This code is only for the specific case of a particle in an infinite potential well, and derives its algorithm from a paper written by Adib Kabir.
